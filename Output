Creating new Ultralytics Settings v0.0.6 file ✅ 
View Ultralytics Settings with 'yolo settings' or at '/root/.config/Ultralytics/settings.json'
Update Settings with 'yolo settings key=value', i.e. 'yolo settings runs_dir=path/to/dir'. For help see https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/#ultralytics-settings.

/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/huggingface_hub/utils/_auth.py:94: UserWarning: 
The secret `HF_TOKEN` does not exist in your Colab secrets.
To authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, create a token in your settings tab (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), set it as secret in your Google Colab and restart your session.
You will be able to reuse this secret in all of your notebooks.
Please note that authentication is recommended but still optional to access public models or datasets.

Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

It looks like you are running Gradio on a hosted a Jupyter notebook. For the Gradio app to work, sharing must be enabled. Automatically setting `share=True` (you can turn this off by setting `share=False` in `launch()` explicitly).

Colab notebook detected. To show errors in colab notebook, set debug=True in launch()
